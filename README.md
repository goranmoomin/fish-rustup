# fish-rustup - rustup support in fish shell

This is a super simple fisher package that sets PATH for you and adds completions for rustup. It uses `psub` internally.

## Installation

You really shouldn't be using this unless you want a `config.fish`less config like me.

``` shell
$ fisher add pcr910303/fish-rustup
```
